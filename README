Thank you for looking at CFPing, and ColdFusion server monitoring tool.
CFPing will eventually be able to check a server by Windows Ping, HTTP Request, SMTP, and others that I see necessary.
CFPing required Window for the use of the Ping method.  Eventually I will figure out how to ping from Mac and Linux and then will add those, but for now Windows is it.
